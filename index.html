                <p>Hi! I am Ananya Kasi. In my high school senior year, a podcast sparked a debate between my father and me about the future of humanity. He leaned towards algorithms dominating our lives while I argued for the enduring significance of the human experience. His references to AI-generated movies tilted our debate toward one side of the Human-Technology equation. I recognized the need to delve deeper into the subject for my comeback. As I embarked on my learning journey at Michigan, my freshman year included a course in Greek classical civilization. One section of the course dealt with the essence of humanity in the presence of technological progress. Little did I anticipate that this would spark my transformative journey into Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).

To explore my interests further, I took classes in Psychology, Philosophy, Cognitive Science, and Public Policy along with my Computer Science major courses. I was exposed to various aspects of human nature (emotions, cognition, decision-making) that helped me gain insights into the complexities of the human mind. Through my Computer Science courses and UI Design class, I realized the importance of prioritizing and understanding human experience in technology development. These led me to explore Public Policy that underlined necessary factors in technology development to safeguard human interests. To further understand the field, during my sophomore year, I met with professors and researchers across CS, Information, Psychology, Philosophy, and Business at the University of Michigan. I also met with industry experts to understand their perspectives. The preparations for these meetings and the learnings helped me conceptualize a rough framework to explore my interests in the interplay between technology and humanity.

My journey further drove me to apply to the ExploreCSResearch (ECSR) program at Michigan. Through this program, I have worked the past year in the ComputationalHCI Lab, advised by Dr. Nikola Banovic. This experience has proven pivotal, as the diverse projects both exposed me to the research process and facilitated the evolution of my nebulous framework into a more tangible concept map. Traversing the map and aided by the different research projects, I have been able to explore various subfields of HCI: Responsible AI, AI Literacy, Trustworthy AI, and misinformation research. While I continued to discover HCI research through my association with the lab, a few members encouraged me to submit a light position paper on an independent project and apply to ACM SIGCHI's South â€“ Asian Winter 2024 school in Colombo. My acceptance to the program and interactions with speakers and participants allowed me to discover and understand the impact of diverse HCI applications for underrepresented communities, aligning with my commitment to using technology for human betterment.
