                    <p>Hi, I'm Ananya! I am passionate about technology, deep learning, and quantum computing. I enjoy technical writing and contributing to open-source projects. In my high school senior year, a podcast sparked a debate between my father and me about the future of humanity. He leaned towards algorithms dominating our lives while I argued for the enduring significance of the human experience. His references to AI-generated movies tilted our debate toward one side of the Human-Technology equation. I recognized the need to delve deeper into the subject for my comeback. As I embarked on my learning journey at Michigan, my freshman year included a course in Greek classical civilization. One section of the course dealt with the essence of humanity in the presence of technological progress. Little did I anticipate that this would spark my transformative journey into Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).</p>
                    <p>To explore my interests further, I took classes in Psychology, Philosophy, Cognitive Science, and Public Policy along with my Computer Science major courses. I was exposed to various aspects of human nature (emotions, cognition, decision-making) that helped me gain insights into the complexities of the human mind. Through my Computer Science courses and UI Design class, I realized the importance of prioritizing and understanding human experience in technology development. These led me to explore Public Policy that underlined necessary factors in technology
