                <p>Hi, I’m Ananya! I work as an undergraduate research assistant at the <a href="https://x.com/comphcilab">Computational HCI</a> lab advised by <a href="https://www.nikolabanovic.net">Dr. Nikola Banovic</a>. I lead and contribute to projects supporting end-users through user literacy, critical reflection, and tech policy which has equipped me with good research skills and helped hone my interests. Through my CS major and other interdisciplinary courses, I have learned technological aspects and more importantly, to ask socio-tech questions around community impact. I believe problems with obscure technology cannot be solved with more obscure technology but by experts grounding themselves in communities they intend to impact.</p>

                <p>My research interests are in the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), specifically Human-AI Interaction (HAI), and Technology Policy. My interest in enhancing support and reducing algorithmic harm for vulnerable communities, like older adults, led me to explore how socio-cognitive theories and design and policy frameworks can inform the design of safe HAI. Through my research exposure and interactions with the HCI community, I am equally interested in work that considers how we, as HCI academics, can augment human-centered design to support multi-stakeholder issues at the intersection of AI and vulnerability.</p>
                <p>I expect to graduate with a BS in <a href="http://cse.umich.edu">Computer Science</a> from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2025. I am applying to PhD programs this Fall and am excited to work on research at the intersection of HCI, Tech Policy and community impact! I’d love to connect to discuss overlapping interests. Please feel free to reach out via <a href="mailto:akasi@umich.edu">email</a>!</p>
